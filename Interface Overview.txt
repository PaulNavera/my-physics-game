Interface Overview
When the player enters the game website, they will see two main options on the home
screen:
1. Story Mode
○ This is where the player experiences the adventure.
○ The game follows the narrative starting from the events after Game 1.
○ After selecting Story Mode (Game 1), a short animated background sequence
will play.
■ This animation or graphic sequence will orient the player on the story
so far.
■ Visual cues (characters, locations, and objects from the previous
mission) will appear to provide context before starting the new
challenge.
■ Brief on-screen text or voiceover will summarize the events of the
previous game.
2. Encyclopedia
○ This section is for deeper learning.
○ Contains explanations of the science concepts used in the game.
○ Includes diagrams, definitions, and examples to help players understand
topics such as temperature, heat, phase changes, and energy.
The Valley of Velocity – Game 1: Emergency Divert Challenge
Setting:
The player is aboard train racing through a scenic valley. The train is powered by a special
Energy Gauge that converts kinetic energy into speed. The landscape outside becomes part
of the puzzle, and the train’s speed directly affects what can be seen, caught, or interacted
with.
Introduction Scene (Narrative Hook)
● How:
The game opens with the train conductor saying:
“We need to get these supplies to the next town, but this train runs on kinetic energy!
The faster we go, the more energy we have — but we have to watch our position
carefully or we’ll miss our delivery points!”
This dialogue quickly links speed and position with energy in context.
● Why:
This anchors the player’s actions in a purposeful story rather than random gameplay.
It also sets up the cause-effect relationship between speed, position, and energy
before the player even starts.
Concept Overview:
In Game 1, the player is placed inside the cockpit of a moving train, complete with a
joystick, speed gauge, and energy gauge. The objective is to relate the speed and position
of the train to the amount of energy possessed by the body (train). The primary challenge is
an “Emergency Divert” scenario.
Gameplay Scene:
● Environment: Blue sky, brown train tracks.
● Perspective: First-person POV from inside the train.
● Controls:
○ Joystick – Controls train direction.
○ Energy Gauge – Displays kinetic energy levels based on current speed.
○ Speed Gauge – Shows current velocity.
● Challenge:
Pop-up Educational Tips:
● When adjusting speed: “Increasing speed increases kinetic energy. More energy
means the train can cover more distance but requires more control.”
● When approaching the diversion point: “Your position and velocity determine if you
can safely divert in time.”
● When energy gauge changes: “The energy shown is proportional to the square of
velocity. Doubling speed quadruples energy.”
Programmer Notes:
How it Works Why it Teaches the Concept
The train needs to climb a steep
hill — player must increase
speed early so enough kinetic
energy is stored to make it up.
Links speed directly to energy: faster
speed = more energy to overcome
obstacles.
A delivery station appears —
player must adjust speed so the
train stops in the exact position
of the platform.
Shows how speed affects where and
when you arrive at a target.
Train enters a “no fuel” section
— player must maintain
momentum by keeping initial
speed high enough to coast
through.
Reinforces that energy gained from
speed carries the train forward
without extra input.
Obstacle suddenly appears —
player must reduce speed
quickly, seeing how reducing
speed lowers kinetic energy and
impact risk.
Demonstrates that less speed
means less kinetic energy to stop or
slow down.
● Train controls must respond in real-time to player input.
● Pop-up system should trigger based on player actions (speed change, proximity to
diversion point, energy level change).
● Ensure track-switching animation is smooth and matches player’s velocity.
● Collision detection must end the round if the player fails to divert before the
disruption.
Game 2- Frostfire Cavern Challenge
Sequence: This game takes place after Game 1 (The Valley of Velocity).
Story Introduction:
After completing the delivery in Game 1, the player receives another urgent task—this time
from a wizard. The player successfully delivers the wizard's package and, as thanks,
receives a Magic Thermometer with the power to edit temperatures.
Scenario:
The player is told the only way to complete the delivery is to cross a bridge. However, the
bridge is blocked by two extreme hazards—ice (too cold) and lava (too hot). The player
must use the Magic Thermometer to adjust the temperatures and make the bridge safe.
Core Mechanic:
The Magic Thermometer works like a temperature/heat simulator (similar to PhET’s phase
change simulation). The player can click and drag controls to raise or lower temperatures,
observing how materials change state (solid, liquid, gas) to clear the path.
Gameplay Flow:
1. Player approaches the bridge and sees ice and lava.
2. Pop-up explains the competency: Understanding temperature, heat transfer, and
phase changes.
3. Pop-up explains the mechanics: Use the Magic Thermometer to adjust the
temperature of different bridge sections.
4. Player needs to complete 5 temperature edits to balance heat and cold so the
bridge can be crossed.
5. Once conditions are safe, the bridge becomes passable.
Competency Applied:
Players learn how temperature changes affect matter, how heat flows between objects, and
how to find balance between extremes.

thermometer and controls)
